  <title>Acknowledgments</title>

<p>I thank my friend Miki Tebeka, who invited me to participate in this
Brain Teaser series.  I am very grateful to my friends Brad Huntting and
Mary Ann Sushinsky who provided clever ideas in the directions of these
puzzles.</p>

<p>I begrudgingly thank Noam Chomsky for arranging computability into a
neat hierarchy, with regular expressions at the bottom.</p>
